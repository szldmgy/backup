\it\LARGE Arrival
\end{center}

\noindent By air: the distance between Changchun International Airport
and the conference hotel is about 50 km. It will cost you about 100
RMB (16 USD c.a.) to take a taxi. For the invited speakers, you
will be picked up at the airport, if
you have sent your arrival information to the organizing committee.\\[4mm]

\noindent By train: there is about 8 km from Changchun railway station to the
conference hotel. The taxi fare is about 16 RMB (2.5 USD c.a.). Changchun
West railway station is 13 km away from the conference hotel. The taxi fare is about
26 RMB (4 USD c.a.)
%Participants who arrive there are suggested to take
%an inter-city high speed train to Xiamen railway station first (22 min., 9 RMB). \\

\end{center}

On-site registration will take place at the {\bf lobby of Guosheng Hotel, Changchun} on {\bf September 11} from {\bf 11:00} to {\bf 21:00}.
You can also register at any ohter time during the conference, but please contact \href{mailto:liuxin@lsec.cc.ac.cn}{Dr. Xin Liu}
or \href{mailto:wjp@lsec.cc.ac.cn}{Ms. Jiping Wu} in advance.\\

\begin{center}
\it\LARGE Currency
\end{center}

Chinese currency is RMB. The current rate is about 6.13 RMB for 1 US
dollar. The exchange of foreign currency can be done at the airport
or the conference hotel. Please keep the receipt of the exchange so
that you can change back to your own currency if you have RMB left
before you leave China. Please notice that some additional
processing fee will be charged if you exchange currency in China.

\bf Changbai Mountain\footnote{From wikipedia:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changbai_Mountains}.}
\end{center}
\large

The Changbai Mountain Range are a mountain range on the border between China and North Korea (41$^\circ$41' to 42$^\circ$51'N;
127$^\circ$43' to 128$^\circ$16'E). In Russia this range is called ``Vostochno-Manchzhurskie gory" (``East Manchurian mountain range") and considered as a part of more long Manchu-Korean mountain range (``Manchzuro-Koreiskie gory"), which separates China from Korea and Russian Primorsky Krai. The range extends from the Northeast Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning to the North Korean provinces of Ryanggang and Chagang. Most peaks exceed 2,000 metres in height, with the highest mountain being Changbai Mountain.

The range represents the mythical birthplace of Buk\={u}ri Yong\u{s}on, ancestor of Nurhaci and the Aisin Gioro Imperial family, who were the founders of the Manchu state and the Chinese Qing Dynasty. The name literally means ``Perpetually White Mountain Region" in Mandarin Chinese.

Changbaishan Nature Reserve, established in 1960, was involved in the UNESCO's ``Man and Biosphere" program in 1980 and becomes part of the world's biosphere reserves. Approved by the State Council in 1986, it becomes a State-level reserve.

The highest mountain is Baekdu Mountain (2,745 m), an active volcano which is also known locally in China as Changbai Mountain. Baekdu Mountain is the source of the Songhua, Tumen (Tuman) and Yalu (Amnok) rivers. Many tributaries of the Liao He also originate from the Changbai Mountains.

The climate in the mountains is very cold during winter, with absolute minima on the highest peaks in January as low as $-$45$^\circ$C ($-$49$^\circ$F), but reaching 17$^\circ$C (62$^\circ$F) in July. Precipitation is low in the winter but in the higher parts very high in the summer, with annual averages reaching as high as 1,150 mm (45 inches) and over 300 mm (12 inches) in July alone. The dry winters mean there are no glaciers even on the highest and wettest peaks, but permafrost extends down to 1,800 metres (5,900 feet) and is continuous on the highest peaks.
